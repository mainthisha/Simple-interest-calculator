## Description
This project explains how to calculate Simple Interest using a basic formula.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated as:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Usage
This calculator can be used to quickly compute simple interest for basic financial calculations.
